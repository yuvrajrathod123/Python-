x, y = 3, 5

# this will print the "x is less than y" without any error
if x < y :                    
    st = "X is less than y"
print(st)

# but this block of code gives an error as : name 'st' is not define 
# so to solve this error we have to use else statment here
if x > y :                    
    st = "X is less than y"
print(st)

# so by using else statement

if x > y :                    
    st = "X is less than y"
else:
    st = "X is greater than y"
print(st)
